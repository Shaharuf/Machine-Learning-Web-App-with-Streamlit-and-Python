# Machine-Learning-Web-App-with-Streamlit-and-Python
This is a simple web application built with Streamlit and Python to demonstrate how to deploy a machine learning model in a web app.  The app is built using the Iris dataset and a Random Forest classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
